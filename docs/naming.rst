* Bucket names must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.

* Bucket names must start and end with a lowercase letter or number.

* Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

* Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).

Example
